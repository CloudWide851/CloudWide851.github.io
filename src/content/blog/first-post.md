# Hello, World!

Welcome to my new personal website. I built this using a modern tech stack to serve as my digital garden.

## Tech Stack

This website is built with:

- **React 18**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript for better developer experience
- **Vite**: Next generation frontend tooling
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework
- **GitHub Pages**: Static site hosting

## Code Snippet

Here is a quick example of how the markdown rendering works:

```typescript
interface GreetingProps {
  name: string;
}

function Greeting({ name }: GreetingProps) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## What's Next?

I plan to use this space to share:

1. Technical tutorials
2. Project updates
3. Experimental demos
4. And maybe some creative writing!

Stay tuned for more updates.
